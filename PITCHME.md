2 streams
====
* How to apply Agile concepts to research problems.
    * Iterate, deliver intermediate assets.
    * The data-value pyramid.
* How to build a big-data web application.
    * Apache Spark, Spark MLlib, Spark Streaming
    * Apache Kafka
    * Doc stores: MongoDB, ElasticSearch
    * Python Flask
    * AirFlow

Note to self: no Postgres.

The data-value pyramid
====
![data-value pyramid](data_value_pyramid.png)

---

ADS Manifesto
====
1. Iterate, iterate, iterate.
2. Ship intermediate assets (avoid the death loop).
3. ‘Prototype experiments’ rather than ‘implement tasks’.
4. Listen to the data (customers, developers, business _and_ data).
5. The data-value pyramid.
6. Find the critical path then focus on it.
7. Get meta, document the analytics process.

(See page 6.)

---

TL;DR
====
1. Formalise and present your intermediate work:
    * to get feedback early on,
    * to remind people you are on the case,
    * because it might be all you have to show for much longer than you think.
3. The data-value pyramid will help you establish and improve your APIs/components sooner rather than later.

**Warning for maths types:** do not turn every little tech task into a research project.

---

For example
====

* People work in Jupyter notebooks that are stored in a central repository.
* Jenkins converts them to scripts and checks that they run without errors.
* When they break we make a decision.
* When we find something good we produce an automated report.
* When a report is liked we promote it to a page to our web app.
* We are climbing up the pyramid!

---

For example
====

* Full Stack Quants is Agile!
* Why wait until my presentation is perfect?
* For example, I haven’t thoroughly read the AirFlow and Spark Streaming sections yet, but there is still plenty to talk about.
* Intermediate assets:
    * Live coding, TDD, Git.
    * Trello for presentations.
    * GitPitch.
    * I am finding tools that make it easier to build content and which fit my
lifestyle.

Big Data Web app
====
The tech components are:
1. Storage.
2. Viewing.
3. Searching.
4. Predictions.
5. Data pipeline.

---

Main tech
====
* Zookeeper to ‘orchestrate’ Kafka, p55. We start a daemon for zookeeper from within the Kafka directory and then start kafka with reference to a zookeeper config file. I checked on SO and find that Kafka _cannot_ be run without zookeeper.
* ElasticSearch to ‘find records’, p50 ‘using ElasticSearch to search our data, to make it easy to find the records we’ll be working so hard to create.’ Does this mean that all the data is available to search, or just the aggregated results? I think it is all indexed; it is searched from the web page. Great idea really, it means you can quite easily browse the data.

---

* ‘Kafka messages are grouped into topics’, p55 ‘we will be using Kafka to deploy predictions using Spark Streaming, but it can do much more.’ On p55 he runs the ‘console producer’ where we can publish messages to a topic (you write some Json) and then the ‘console consumer’ plays it back.
* Spark streaming has a ‘period’ of 10 seconds and ‘creates a Kafka stream’, p57. It listens to Kafka messages and acts on them — Russell prints the message in a Kafka object to the pyspark console.
* Apache Airflow to manage batch processing. AA uses DAGs. Clever that it can backfill so easily.

---

* p112 builds an index in ES for the flight information that is displayed in a page. It will provide a search box for the page, see p113: ‘Note that this might take some time, as there are several million records to index. You might want to leave this alone to run for a while.’
* Note that the data is passed to ES in batches from Spark. Not sure why it is done from Spark (later: because the data is all stored via Spark).

---

The storage bit
====
Data is stored in 5 places:
1. Wget into files, p91. (273 MB or 315 MB?)
2. Load into Spark, p92.
3. SQL from Spark to JSON and Parquet files, p93. (259 MB, 248 MB). I guess that these files are distributed across the cluster.
4. From Spark to MongoDB, p95.
5. From Spark to ElsaticSearch, p113.

---

* the flight data is wget on p91. It is load to spark on p92. It is then saved to the data dir in Parquet format on p93.
* The storage happens on p94: ‘Note that the Parquet file is only 248 MB, compared with 315 MB for the original gzip-compressed CSV and 259 MB for the gzip-compressed JSON. In practice the Parquet will be much more performant, as it will only load the individual columns we actually use in our PySpark scripts.’
* On p95 the whole rdd is loaded into MongoDB. That means that there are multiple copies of the data.
* On p113 the whole RDD is loaded to ElasticSearch in batches of 100. ‘Note that this might take some time, as there are several million records to index’.

---

Storage formats
====
* JSON lines is just JSON by line, typically a dict per line. Like CSV really.

---

The web app
====
* The first few pages show (paginated) all the flights between 2 airports on a given date, p109. This data comes from MongoDB.
* The next iteration is to allow a search with ES, p117.

---

Agile checkpoints
====
* p102 proposes we release the app without search, even though ‘To get real utility from this data, we need list and search capabilities.’
* Why? Because we need User validation: ‘“Does anyone care about flights?” and “What do they want to know about a given flight?” We think we have answers to these questions: “Yes” and “Airline, origin, destination, tail number, date, air time, and distant ce flown.” But without validation, we don’t really know anything for certain.’

---

* ‘The other reason to ship something now is that the act of publishing, presenting, and sharing your work will highlight a number of problems in your platform setup that would likely otherwise go undiscovered until the moment you launch your product.’

---

Batch processing with AirFlow
====
* on p242 there is a web endpoint set up for generating prediction requests. These will be processed as if they are a daily request, and might result in a daily email in your inbox.
